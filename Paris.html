			<p>Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its picturesque 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture, and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore.</p>

			<p>There are direct flights to Paris from just about every country in the world. If you are coming from the USA of course the easiest way to get to Paris is to fly from whatever city is closest to you that has flights to Paris. Most likely are New York, Washington, Atlanta, Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles and you probably get the idea. For those of you who don't know the rules of the game here is how it generally works if you are looking for cheap fares. Airlines break up seats on a particular flight by price. Let's say there are 250 seats on a plane in the economy section. Maybe forty of those seats will be offered at the lowest price. When they are gone the next forty will be at a price slightly higher. When these are gone then the next group is slightly higher until you get to the last group of tickets, generally the biggest and most expensive. So in other words to get the cheapest seats you have to book early. But it is not so simple. Because maybe on a flight for April 21st the only tickets left are the most expensive, but April 22nd there are three cheap tickets left.</p>
